**Summary of Artemis Financial and Software Requirements:**

Artemis Financial is the client, a financial institution focused on ensuring the security of sensitive financial data. 
They tasked me with enhancing the security of their SSL Server application, which involves encrypting data, securing communication channels, 
and fortifying the overall application against potential vulnerabilities. Essentially, they wanted to ensure that their software could 
protect sensitive financial information from unauthorized access or tampering.

**Addressing Software Security Vulnerabilities:**

One thing I did well was to thoroughly analyze the application's structure and identify potential vulnerabilities during the Architecture Review phase. 
This laid the groundwork for subsequent stages of refactoring. Coding securely is crucial because it helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, 
and other security incidents that could damage the company's reputation and lead to financial losses. Software security adds value to a company's overall 
wellbeing by instilling customer trust, meeting regulatory requirements, and maintaining a competitive edge in the industry.

**Challenges and Benefits of Vulnerability Assessment:**

One challenging yet helpful aspect of the vulnerability assessment was conducting in-depth testing to identify and address vulnerabilities. 
This involved both secondary static testing using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check Maven and functional testing. Identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating them is 
crucial for enhancing the application's security posture.

**Increasing Layers of Security:**

To increase layers of security, I implemented various measures such as using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher for encryption, converting HTTP to HTTPS 
protocol for secure communication, and leveraging the Spring Security framework for authentication and authorization. In the future, I would use comprehensive 
vulnerability assessment tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to prioritize based on their severity and impact.

**Ensuring Code and Application Security:**

To ensure the code and application were functional and secure, I conducted rigorous testing, including both secondary static testing and functional testing. 
After refactoring the code, I checked for any newly introduced vulnerabilities by repeating the testing process and refining the design and code until no 
new vulnerabilities were discovered.

**Resources, Tools, and Coding Practices:**

In this assignment, I utilized industry-standard encryption algorithms, cryptographic best practices, secure coding patterns, and tools like OWASP Dependency-Check Maven. 
These resources, tools, and coding practices will be helpful in future assignments or tasks requiring secure software development.

**Examples for Future Employers:**

From this assignment, I would showcase my ability to analyze and enhance the security of software applications, my proficiency in implementing industry-standard encryption 
and security protocols, and my experience in conducting thorough testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Additionally, I would highlight my adherence to secure 
coding practices and my commitment to ensuring the security and integrity of software systems.
